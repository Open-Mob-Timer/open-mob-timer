# Open Mob Timer
Your free, open source Mob Timer for remote teams.

Open Mob timer isn't just any mob timer. Nope! This one integrates socket.io to keep everyone in the loop while still keeping it simple. 

Create a team, then copy the link to share with your team members. Everyone with the link can keep an eye on the timer without having to rely on Jerry G to remember to start the timer between drivers. Dang it, Jerry!
