## Welcome!
Open Mob Timer isn't just any mob timer. Nope! This one integrates socket.io to keep everyone in the loop while still keeping it simple.

Create a team, then copy the link to share with your team members. Everyone with the link can keep an eye on the timer without having to rely on Jerry G to remember to start the timer between drivers. Dang it, Jerry!
